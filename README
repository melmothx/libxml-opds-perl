XML-OPDS

This module facilitates the creation of OPDS feeds.

The specifications can be found at http://opds-spec.org while the
validator is at http://opds-validator.appspot.com

The idea is that it should be enough to pass the navigation links and
the title entries with some data, and have the feed back.

The OPDS feeds are basically Atom feeds, hence this module uses
XML::Atom under the hood.
