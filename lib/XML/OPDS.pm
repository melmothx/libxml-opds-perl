=head1 NAME

XML::OPDS - OPDS (Open Publication Distribution System) feed creation

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.04

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.04';


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module facilitates the creation of OPDS feeds.

The specifications can be found at L<http://opds-spec.org/> while the
validator is at L<http://opds-validator.appspot.com/>.

The idea is that it should be enough to pass the navigation links and
the title entries with some data, and have the feed back.

The OPDS feeds are basically Atom feeds, hence this module uses
L<XML::Atom> under the hood.

Some features are not supported yet, but patches are welcome. Also
keep in mind that the applications which are supposed to talk to your
server have a level of support which varies from decent to "keep
crashing".

This is still very much a work in progress, but it's already
generating valid and usable catalogs.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use XML::OPDS;
  my $feed = XML::OPDS->new(prefix => 'http://amusewiki.org');
  # add two links, self and start are mandatory.
  $feed->add_to_navigations(
                            rel => 'self',
                            title => 'Root',
                            href => '/',
                           );
  $feed->add_to_navigations(
                            rel => 'start',
                            title => 'Root',
                            href => '/',
                           );
  # add a navigation for the title list, marking as leaf, where the
  # download links can be retrieved.
  $feed->add_to_navigations(
                            title => 'Titles',
                            description => 'texts sorted by title',
                            href => '/titles',
                            acquisition => 1,
                           );
  # and render
  print $feed->render;
  # you can reuse the object for leaf feeds (i.e. the acquistion
  # feeds), pushing another self navigation, which will replace the
  # previous one.
  $feed->add_to_navigations(
                            rel => 'self',
                            title => 'Titles',
                            description => 'texts sorted by title',
                            href => '/titles',

                           );
  # or, implicitely setting the self rel and cleaning the navigation
  # stash, keeping the meta
  $feed->add_to_navigations_new_level(
                                      title => 'Titles',
                                      acquisition => 1,
                                      href => '/titles',
                                     );
  $feed->add_to_acquisitions(
                             href => '/my/title',
                             title => 'My title',
                             files => [ '/my/title.epub' ],
                            );
  # and here we have an acquisition feed, because of the presence of
  # the acquisition.
  print $feed->render;

=head1 ENCODING

Even if the module wants characters as input (decoded strings, not
bytes), the output XML is an UTF-8 encoded string.

=head1 SETTERS/ACCESSORS

=head2 navigations

Arrayref of L<XML::OPDS::Navigation> objects. An object with a rel
C<self> (the feed itself) and one with the rel C<start> (the root
feed) are mandatory. If not present, the module will crash while
rendering the feed.

=head2 acquisitions

Arrayref of L<XML::OPDS::Acquisition> objects. If one or more objects
are present, the feed will become an acquistion feed.

=head2 author

The producer of the feed. Defaults to this class name and version.

=head2 author_uri

The uri of the author. Defaults to L<http://amusewiki.org> (which is
the home of this class).

=head2 prefix

Default to the empty string. On instances of this class, by itself has
no effect. However, when calling C<add_to_acquisitions> and
C<add_to_navigations>, it will be passed to the constructors of those
objects.

This is usually the hostname of the OPDS server. So you need just to
pass, e.g. 'http://amusewiki.org' and have all the links prefixed by
that (no slash mangling or adding is performed). If you are going to
pass the full urls, leave it at the default.

=head2 updated

Default to current timestamp. When calling C<create_navigation> or
C<create_acquistion>, use this timestamp as default.

=head2 logo

The feed logo. If prefix is set, prepend it.

=head2 icon

The feed icon. If prefix is set, prepend it.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 render

Return the generated xml.

=head2 atom

Return the L<XML::Atom::Feed> object.

=head2 create_navigation(%args)

Create a L<XML::OPDS::Navigation> object inheriting the prefix.

=head2 create_acquisition(%args)

Create a L<XML::OPDS::Acquisition> object inheriting the prefix.

=head2 add_to_navigations(%args)

Call C<create_navigation> and add it to the C<navigations> stack.

=head2 add_to_navigations_new_level(%args)

Like C<add_to_navigations>, but it's meant to be used for
C<rel:self> elements.

The C<rel:self> attribute is injected in the arguments which are
passed to C<create_navigation>.

If a navigation with the attribute C<rel> set to C<self> was already
present in the stack, the new one will become the new C<self>, while
the old one will become an C<up> rel.

Also, this will remove any existing navigation with the C<rel>
attribute set to C<subsection>, given that you are creating a new
level.

This is designed to play well with chained actions (so you can reuse
the object, stack selfs, and the result will be correct).

=head2 add_to_acquisitions(%args)

Call C<create_acquisition> and add it to the C<acquisition> stack.

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

=head2 navigation_entries

Return a list of L<XML::OPDS::Navigation> objects excluding unique
relationships like C<self>, C<start>, C<up>, C<previous>, C<next>,
C<first>, C<last>.

=head2 navigation_hash

Return an hashref, where the keys are the C<rel> attributes of the
navigation objects. The value is an object if the navigation is meant
to be unique, or an arrayref of objects if not so.

=head2 is_acquisition

Return true if there are acquisition objects stacked.

=head1 OPENSEARCH RESULTS

The following attributes can be set if you are building an Atom
response for OpenSearch. See L<XML::OPDS::OpenSearch::Query> for a
concrete example.

A L<Data::Page> object with the specification of the pages.

=head2 search_result_terms

A string with the query for which you are serving the results.

=head2 search_result_queries

Additional Query elements, should be an arrayref of
L<XML::OPDS::OpenSearch::Query> objects.
